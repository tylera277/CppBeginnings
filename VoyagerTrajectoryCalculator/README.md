ULTIMATE GOAL: To compute when a interplanetary trip like the Voyager's mission, can take place in the future.

DONE - Step 1: Get the 4th order Runge-Kutta working for a simple system of the Earth orbiting the Earth around the Sun located at the origin of the system.

Step 2: Get the output from the C++ program plotted in python more dynamically. i.e. can see objects moving over time instead of just seeing its overall end path that it took.

Step 3: Place more than one planet in the system orbiting the sun.

Step 4: Calculate a mass of negligible amount, a craft, being shot from the earth at some angle with some speed and see its trajectory evolve over time.

Step 5: Get a simple 1-body gravitational slingshot of the craft around a planetary body other than its starting point of the Earth.

.

Step x: Somehow figure out what angle and speed needs to be given to the craft in order for it to get the slingshot affect from another body

Step x+1: Somehow chain these slingshots together so that the craft can go from one body to another

Step x+2:...

Program which computes the trajectory of a planet in C++ then outputs that into an intermediate csv file to then be taken in
by a python program to be plotted in matplotlib.
